                <h2>Famous musician Quotes</h2>
                <p>Lets be honest. I was trying to create a web page that had some sort of content
                    that was pretty to look at. That being said, I found these particular quotes to be inspiring,
                    and let me tell you, there were a lot that did not make the cut. 
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>Right, so; to conclude. <br />
                I do not know a lot about musical history. <br />
            I do enjoy playing music. <br />
        That about sums up my musical history knowledge. <br/>
    I enjoyed making this project. This was great html and css practice!
